# PLK1
This repo contains MATLAB codes on figures 2, 3, 6, and 7 for simulating Plk1-p53 cell cycle networks.
We exclude the simulations of Fig.4-5 becuase they have big megabite data. 
When Fig2 main is run, Fig2A MATLAB file is automatically joined to Fig.2.  
To simulate Fig3, 6, and 7, please run the corresponding main files. 
When each main code is run, three family files of (1) Jung_eqn.m, (2) JUNG_init_parameters.m, 
and (3) JUNG_constant_variables.m are simutaneouly run.
