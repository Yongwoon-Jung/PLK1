# PLK1
This contains code for PLK1 cell cycle simulations.
The Execusion files such as main (present the beahviors of 50 protein and protein complexes), FIG2, FIG3, FIG7, and Fig8 are ready for readers to demonstrate. 
Eqn, constant valriables, initial parameters are key files needed to conduct those execusion files.
We have 34 ODEs(Odinary Differential Equations) and 137 parameters and 50 protein and protein complexes.
From these codes, we show how p53 and Plk1 are cooperated well to proceed normal cell cycle progression.
If one of them (p53 and Plk1) is deficient and eliminated, the cell cycle system does not go on.  Thus we present a potential scenario or hypotheis about how they are connected to accomplish their key roles.
All other important concepts are described in depth in the corresponding paper.
