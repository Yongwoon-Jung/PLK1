# PLK1
This repo contains MATLAB codes for simulating figures 2, 3, 6, and 7 for the PLK1 cell cycle simulations.
We exclude the simulations of Fig.4-5 becuase they have big megabite data. 
To simulate Fig2, Fig2A MATLAB file should be accompanied.  

When running the code for figure 2, Fig2A_2019Paper.fig is needed.
When running the code for all figures, Jung_eqn.m, JUNG_init_parameters.m, and JUNG_constant_variables.m are needed.
