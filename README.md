# PLK1
This contains codes for PLK1 cell cycle simulations.
The Execusion files such as main (present the beahviors of 50 protein and protein complexes), FIG2, FIG3, FIG7, and Fig8 are ready for readers to demonstrate. 
Eqn, constant valriables, initial parameters are key files needed to conduct those execusion files.
We have 34 ODEs(Ordinary Differential Equations) and 137 parameters and 50 protein and protein complexes.
From these codes, we show how p53 and Plk1 are cooperated well to proceed normal cell cycle progression by directly or indirectly influencing the production of Mad2:Cdc20P, which is the major indicator of proper and functional cell cycle system.
If one of them (p53 and Plk1) is deficient and eliminated, the cell cycle system does not go on smoothly.  Thus we present a potential scenario or hypotheis about how they are connected to accomplish their key roles.
All other important concepts are described in depth in the corresponding paper.
